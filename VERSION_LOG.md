* added  

### Bug fixes
* corrected the separator from "" to "/" in ./multiarea_model/data_multiarea/SLN_logdensities.R to fix the file path of ./multiarea_model/data_multiarea/bbAlt.R


## MAM 1.0.0

This code implements the spiking network model of macaque visual cortex developed at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6), Research Center JÃ¼lich.

The model has been documented in the following publications:

1. Schmidt M, Bakker R, Hilgetag CC, Diesmann M & van Albada SJ Multi-scale account of the network structure of macaque visual cortex Brain Structure and Function (2018), 223: 1409 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-017-1554-4

2. Schuecker J, Schmidt M, van Albada SJ, Diesmann M & Helias M (2017) Fundamental Activity Constraints Lead to Specific Interpretations of the Connectome. PLOS Computational Biology, 13(2): e1005179. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005179

3. Schmidt M, Bakker R, Shen K, Bezgin B, Diesmann M & van Albada SJ (2018) A multi-scale layer-resolved spiking network model of resting-state dynamics in macaque cortex. PLOS Computational Biology, 14(9): e1006359. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006359

The code in this repository is self-contained and allows one to reproduce the results of all three papers.

The code was improved since the above publications to function with more modern versions of NEST (3+) as well as other minor updates.

### Bug fixes
* corrected the url of NEST logo in README.md
